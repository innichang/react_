# Styling Reract Apps with Vanilla CSS

### PROS
  1. CSS code is decoupled from JSX code
  2. you write CSS code as you know and (maybe) love it
  3. CSS code can be written by another developer who needs only a minimal amount of access to your JSX code

### CONS
  1. You need to know CSS
  2. CSS code is not scoped to components -> (e.g., some CSS class name used in different components for different purposes)
